    <h1>ABOUT UP</h1>
    The history of Uttar Pradesh is very ancient and interesting. 
    It is recognised in the later Vedic Age as Brahmarshi Desha or Madhya Desha. 
    Many great sages of the Vedic times like Bhardwaja, Gautam, Yagyavalkaya, Vashishtha, Vishwamitra and Valmiki flourished in this state. 
    Several sacred books of the Aryans were also composed here. 
    Two great epics of India, Ramayana and Mahabharata, appear to have been inspired by Uttar Pradesh.
